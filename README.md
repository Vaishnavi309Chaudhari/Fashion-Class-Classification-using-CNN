The global fashion industry, valued at three trillion dollars and making up 2% of global GDP, is rapidly evolving by embracing computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning innovations.

In this scenario, imagine a retailer engaging your expertise to create a virtual styling assistant. This assistant would analyze customer images from Instagram and Facebook to identify the fashion categories they're wearing, such as bags, dresses, and pants. The goal is for this virtual assistant to aid in spotting fashion trends and supporting targeted marketing strategies.

For this case study, we’ll use the Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes images of items like bags, shoes, and dresses. Our task involves building a deep learning model that can categorize these images into one of ten classes.

The app or model we aim to develop should be capable of examining an image and accurately identifying the clothing or accessory category it belongs to—be it a top, bag, hat, or other. This is our main objective.

The dataset contains 28x28 pixel grayscale images, each associated with a target class among ten possible labels. These labels include categories like T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, ankle boots, and sneakers, among others.
